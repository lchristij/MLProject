# Stock Trading Algo Project:
Our goal is to use Alpaca stock data to build a model consisting of multiple features applied to a stock for purposes of determining which are significant for producing positive returns.  The significant features will then be used as an input in the algorithm to determine whether a stock captured by AWS Lex should be bought or sold.


## Data Sets, Packages/Libraries and Visualization:
1. https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview - 5yrs of Stock Data consisting of last trade, last quote, 1-30min, 1-4hrs, daily, weekly and monthly bar data.
2. https://www.kaggle.com/ - Relative Strength Index and Moving Average Convergence & Divergence Technical Indicator Data
3. Sklearn ensemble Random Forest Classifier, make_classification dataset, confusion matrix, accuracy score, classification report, train_test_split and Standard Scaler
